# Golden Test Data

All computational correctness in goeph is validated against [Skyfield](https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield) via golden tests. The JSON files in this directory are the source of truth.

## Generating golden data

```bash
cd testdata
/opt/anaconda3/bin/python generate_golden.py
```

Requires Python 3 with `skyfield` installed. The script loads `../data/de440s.bsp` and writes all `golden_*.json` files. These are checked into git so CI runs without Python or Skyfield.

## Sampling strategy

**Primary grid:** 3,653 dates at 30-day increments across the full DE440s range (1850-2149).

This is dense enough to catch systematic drift from approximations (nutation, delta-T, precession) and error growth over centuries away from J2000. Fine-grained sampling is unnecessary because the underlying physics is smooth (Chebyshev polynomials, continuous rotations).

**Bodies tested:** 10 bodies for position/velocity/apparent (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto barycenters). 3 bodies for altaz (Sun, Moon, Mars) across 6 observer locations.

## Tolerance summary

All tolerances are measured max error vs Skyfield across the full date range.

| `golden_sidereal.json` | GMST | 1e-3 | ~5e-4 | degrees | IAU 1982 Meeus vs Skyfield's IERS 2000 ERA-based |

### Coordinate transforms

| Golden file | Test | Tolerance | Measured max | Units | Error source |

| `golden_altaz.json` | Azimuth | 0.02 | ~0.010 | degrees | GMST formula + minor near-horizon geometry effects |

### Angular quantities

| Golden file | Test | Tolerance | Measured max | Units | Error source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Almanac events

| Golden file | Test | Tolerance | Match rate | Units | Error source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `golden_seasons.json` | Seasons (equinox/solstice) | 1 day | 100% | days | J2000 ecliptic vs Skyfield's ecliptic of date |
| `golden_moon_phases.json` | Moon phases | 1 day | ≥99% | days | J2000 ecliptic vs ecliptic of date |
| `golden_sunrise_sunset.json` | Sunrise/sunset (NYC 2024) | 5 min | ≥99% | days | Nutation/GMST frame differences |
| `golden_twilight.json` | Twilight (NYC Jan 2024) | 10 min | ≥95% | days | Most sensitive to nutation/frame differences |
| `golden_oppositions.json` | Oppositions/conjunctions (Mars) | 1 day | 100% | days | J2000 ecliptic vs ecliptic of date |

Almanac golden data generated by `generate_golden_almanac.py` using Skyfield's almanac functions. Tolerances are larger than core position tests because goeph uses J2000 ecliptic while Skyfield uses ecliptic of date — this causes up to ~18 hours offset for seasons and similar systematic shifts for moon phases and oppositions. Sunrise/sunset and twilight are more precise (~minutes) but have lower match rates due to edge cases near polar regions and rapid twilight transitions.

### Other

| Golden file | Test | Tolerance | Measured max | Units | Error source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `golden_lunarnodes.json` | Lunar node longitude | 1e-8 | ~1e-9 | degrees | Identical Meeus formula |

## Dominant error sources

**Geodetic→ecliptic and apparent positions (~20 arcsec):** Skyfield's golden data generator uses `observe()` which applies iterative light-time correction even for geographic locations on Earth's surface. During the ~0.02 seconds of light travel (6400 km), Earth's orbital motion displaces the position by ~0.6 km (~20 arcsec). goeph computes the surface position at the observation time directly, without this light-time iteration.

**GMST formula (~0.3 arcsec at T=1):** goeph uses the IAU 1982 Meeus GMST formula; Skyfield uses the IERS 2000 ERA-based formula. These differ by up to ~0.3 arcsec per century from J2000.

**Equation of equinoxes complementary terms (~0.003 arcsec):** Skyfield includes additional complementary terms in the equation of equinoxes that goeph omits. This is negligible.

## Nutation mode

Golden tests that compare nutation-dependent computations (geodetic→ecliptic, altaz) use `coord.NutationFull` mode to match Skyfield's full IAU 2000A model. The tolerances listed above reflect this mode. With the default `NutationStandard` (30 terms), results are ~0.001 arcsec less precise — negligible compared to the dominant error sources listed above.

## Golden file format

All files are JSON with a top-level `tests` array. Each test entry includes the input parameters and expected output values from Skyfield. See `generate_golden.py` for the exact schema of each file.
